<p>ToyoBrowser is an application that collects all the information available by models and years as well as features
    available in each Toyota model. In turn, it would also be useful to determine the customer's needs
    (color, features, etc.) from the vendor's point of view. ToyoBrowser arises from the need to understand 
    and have quick access to all the information related to Toyota models and to respond promptly to the customer. 
    Although Toyota has some related applications 
    these are a bit obsolete and limited. With ToyoBrowser you can not only search for models
    and submodels (Trims) but you can compare them or find which models have a specific feature.</p>
